### Create_imgseq


This file generated the input file for the scannner task (i.e the image sequence for the given subject).  I think you'd have to create the first trial and then the macro would fill in the rest. Output was copy/pasted into another file called 'bmpsequence.xls' which was called by the prog that was running the expt in the scanner.
