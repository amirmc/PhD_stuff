## Switch task files


These files formed part of the work in the second two years of the thesis.  The resulting paper citation is "Hampshire A, Chaudhry AM, Owen AM, Roberts AC (2011). Dissociable roles for lateral orbitofrontal cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex during preference driven reversal learning. Neuroimage"

### Specific notes

I've not included the image files I used so there will be empty folders here (e.g anything that refers to FacePics or Stimuli).  These are available on request and can also be found on the CD that went in with my thesis (as if that's ever going to see the light of day again...)

The macros are kind-of separated from the vb program stuff but in reality they were all a bit mixed up.  The macros were written in VBA in Excel and if I were to redo any of them, I'd try and use python instead. They've been copied into text files and hopfully they make sense.
